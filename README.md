Implementation of self-balancing binary tree.
A self-balancing binry tree is used store words from a text file. 
The self-balancing binary tree is later used to retrieve the most frequently occuring words from the text file.

Highlights: Outputs the top 50 most frequent words of a 10,000-word text file in <0.2 seconds. On-par with fastest programming solution from a tutor in the course.
